/*
Pairs and lists instead of arrays are used to represent matrices in these codes

Here, a n x 1 matrix (a matrix with n rows and 1 column) is represented by a list of n lists. Each of the list containing 1 element:
i.e. 
list(list(1), // index 0
     list(2), // index 1
     list(3),
     ...
     list(n)) // index n - 1
     
A 1 x n matrix (a matrix with 1 row and n columns) is represented by a list of a single list, which contains n elements. 
i.e.
list(list(1, 2, 3, ..., n))

Thus an m x n matrix can be represented with:
list(list(1, 2, ..., n), //index 0, row 1
     list(1, 2, ..., n), // index 1, row 2
     ...
     list(1, 2, ..., n)) // index m, row m - 1
