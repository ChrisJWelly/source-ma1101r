# source-ma1101r
Attempting to program MA1101R Linear Algebra I, using CS1101S' Source (AY18/19 Sem1)


Goals:
1. Basic Matrix functions:
   1.1. matrix_equality
   1.2. transpose
   1.3. is_triangular
   1.4. is_symmetric
2. Matrix Multiplication
3. Gaussian Elimination:
   3.1. EROs (done)
   3.2. GE up to Row-Echelon Form (could refer to 2018 Mock PA)
   3.3. GJE up to Reduced Row-Echelon Form [important to work towards!]
   3.4. Using RREF to return solution to a system (maybe in the form of a list?)
4. Functions related to orthogonality:
   4.1. Dot product (should work if both are rows or both are columns)
   4.2. is_orthogonal (for two vectors)
   4.3. is_orthogonal_set (for a list of vectors)
   4.4. Gram-Schmidt Process (transforms a list of vectors to a list where is_orthogonal_set            returns true) [current ultimate goal!]
