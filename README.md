# source-ma1101r
Attempting to program MA1101R Linear Algebra I, using CS1101S' Source (AY18/19 Sem1)


Goals:
1. Basic Matrix functions:
   - [ ] matrix_equality
   - [ ] transpose
   - [ ] is_triangular
   - [ ] is_symmetric
2. Matrix Operations:
   - [x] Matrix Addition
   - [x] Matrix Subtraction
   - [x] Scalar Multiplication
   - [ ] Matrix Multiplication
3. Gaussian Elimination:
   - [x] EROs
   - [ ] GE up to Row-Echelon Form (could refer to 2018 Mock PA)
   - [ ] GJE up to Reduced Row-Echelon Form *important to work towards!*
   - [ ] Using RREF to return solution to a system (maybe in the form of a list?)
4. Functions related to orthogonality:
   - [ ] Dot product (should work if both are rows or both are columns)
   - [ ] is_orthogonal (for two vectors)
   - [ ] is_orthogonal_set (for a list of vectors)
   - [ ] Gram-Schmidt Process (transforms a list of vectors to a list where is_orthogonal_set returns true) *current ultimate goal!*
