# source-ma1101r
Attempting to program MA1101R Linear Algebra I, using CS1101S' Source (AY18/19 Sem1 edition)  
Programs are based on the MA1101R textbook Linear Algebra: Concepts on Euclidean Spaces (2nd Edition) by Ma, Tan and Ng, as well as concepts introduced in tutorials/homeworks/exams of AY18/19 Sem 1

Goals:
1. Basic Matrix functions:
   - [x] Matrix Equality
   - [x] transpose
   - [x] is_triangular
   - [x] is_diagonal
   - [x] is_symmetric
   - [x] Determinant
   - [x] Adjoint
   - [x] Inverse
2. Matrix Operations:
   - [x] Matrix Addition
   - [x] Matrix Subtraction
   - [x] Scalar Multiplication
   - [x] Matrix Multiplication
3. Gaussian Elimination:
   - [x] EROs
   - [ ] GE up to Row-Echelon Form (could refer to CS1101S AY18/19 Sem1 Mock PA)
   - [ ] GJE up to Reduced Row-Echelon Form (*important to work towards!*)
   - [ ] Using RREF to return solution to a system (maybe in the form of a list?)
4. Functions related to orthogonality:
   - [ ] Dot product (should work if both are rows or both are columns)
   - [ ] is_orthogonal (for two vectors)
   - [ ] is_orthogonal_set (for a list of vectors)
   - [ ] Gram-Schmidt Process (transforms a list of vectors to a list where is_orthogonal_set returns true) (*current ultimate goal!*)
5. Miscellaneous:
   - [ ] Trace of a matrix
   - [ ] is_stochastic
